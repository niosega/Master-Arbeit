%************************************************

ISL, the Integer Set Library, is a C library handling sets and relations of integer points bounded by affine constraints. Sets and maps can be described with numerical values as well as with parameter values. The computations are done in exact integer arithmetic. 

There are multiple data structure inside ISL. Here is a quick overview of concepts needed to understand the next parts of this report.
